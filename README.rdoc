= Simple Navigation Example

An example rails app using the simple_navigation gem

== Requirements

* haml gem
* simple_navigation gem
* Rails 2.3.3

== Install

Checkout the sources:

  git clone git://github.com/mexpolk/simple_navigation_example.git

Install the required gems, from the command line run:

  sudo gem install haml
  sudo gem install mexpolk-simple_navigation --source http://gems.github.com

== Notes

What I did in this app:

* config/environment.rb: Configured simple_navigation gem
* config/initializers/simple_navigation.rb: This is where navigation menus (like the one you're seeing right now) are configured.
* public/javascripts and public/style_sheets: Added some javascript and CSS (kind of messy, will fix it later) for the menu to work.
